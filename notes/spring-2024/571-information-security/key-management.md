# Key Management

Distribution of keys is a very difficult problem because you cannot anticipate
lost keys, who wants to communicate, compromised keys, users leaving, revoking
keys. etc. These problems all pertain to key management.

Some solutions rely on a trusted authority pre distributing keys through a
secure channel. That allows every pair of users determine a shared key
(non-interactively).

Session key distribution focuses on key management for short sessions.



## Long vs Short Lived Keys 

Long lived keys are stored more securely than short lived keys.
