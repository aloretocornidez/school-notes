# Chapter 2

Learning Goals:

- Understand the concept of divisibility and the division algorithm.
- Understand how to use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common
  divisor.
- Present an overview of the concepts of modular arithmetic.
- Explain the operation of the extended Euclidean algorithm.
- Discuss key concepts relating to prime numbers.
- Understand Fermat’s theorem.
- Understand Euler’s theorem.
- Define Euler’s totient function.
- Make a presentation on the topic of testing for primality.
- Explain the Chinese remainder theorem.
- Define discrete logarithms.

The first three sections focus on information in number theory required to work
with finite fields.

- Divisibilty
- Euclidian algorithm
- Modular arithmetic

## Divisibility and The Division Algorithm

### Divisibility

Nonzero b divides a if a = mb for some m, where a, b, and m are integers.

Properties of Divisibility:

- if $a|1$, then $a = \pm 1$
