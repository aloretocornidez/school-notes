# Chapter 1

Learning Objectives After studying this chapter, you should be able to:

- Describe the key security requirements of confidentiality, integrity, and
  availability.
- Discuss the types of security threats and attacks that must be dealt with and
  give examples of the types of threats and attacks that apply to different
  categories of computer and network assets.
- Provide an overview of keyless, single-key, and two-key cryptographic
  algorithms.
- Provide an overview of the main areas of network security.
- Describe a trust model for information security.
- List and briefly describe key organizations involved in cryptography
  standards.

## Cybersecurity, Information Security, and Network Security

Cyber Security: The protection of information that is stored transmitted and
processed in a networked system of computers.

Subsets of Cybersecurity:

- Information Security:

  Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of Information

- Network Security:

  Protection of networks from unauthorized modification, destruction, and
  disclosure. Ensure that the network can perform critical duties.

Security Objectives

- Confidentiality:

  Data confidentiality: Ensure that private or confidential information is not
  made available to unauthorized parties.

  Privacy: Individuals control or influence what information related to them may
  be collected and stored by whom and to whom that information may be disclosed.

The Challenges of Information Security

- Integrity:

  Data integrity: Ensures that data and programs are indeed what they claim to
  be and can only be changed in authorized manners and only by authorized
  individuals.

  System integrity: Assures that a system performs its intended function in an
  unimpaired manner.

- Availability:

  Assures that systems work promptly and service is not denied to authorized
  users.

  CIA Triad:

  - Confidentiality
  - Integrity
  - Availability

## The OSI Security Architecture

A standardized way of evaluating security products and policies.

Security attack: any action compromises the information owned by an
organization.

Security Mechanism: A process or device designed to detect, prevent, or recover
from a security attack.

Security Service: A processing or communication service that enhances the
security of the data processing systems and the information transfers of an
organization.

Threat: Any circumstance or event with potential to adversely impact
organizational operations, assets, individuals, other organizations, or the
Nation through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction,
disclosure, modification of information, and/or denial of service.

Attack: Any kind of malicious activity that attempts to collect, disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information systems o fthe information itself.
