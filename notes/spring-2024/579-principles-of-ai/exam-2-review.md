# Exam 2 Review

## Alpha Beta Pruning

Alpha Beta Pruning is used in Game Theory to find how the AI should act to
minimize or maximize parameters.

Alpha beta pruning would not be effective if there is no adversarial aspect to
the game.

## AI Production System

An AI Production system is is a framework/architecture used in in AI to develop
and deploy intelligent systems capable of solving specific problems or
performing autonomous tasks.

The key components of an AIPS are as follows:

1. Knowledge Base: Stores domain specific facts that are relevant to the
   problem. Namely, 'if-then' rules that can be used to approach a solution to
   the problem at hand.

2. Inference Engine: Uses logic to perform reasoning and make decision based on
   the knowledge present in the knowledge base.

3. Working Memory: Stores data of the current state of a system to use when
   selecting applied rules.

4. Control Strategy: The CS governs the flow control within a system. Applies
   rules from the knowledge base, handles conflicts, manages resources, and
   controls the overall behavior of the system.

5. User Interface: The system used to interface the AIPS with the user of the
   system. Can be an API or a gui used to input data and problem
   characteristics.

6. Explanation Facility: Only provided by some AIPS, gives the user the
   rationale behind the AIPS' actions. This is useful for AIPS that work to
   solve a problem that requires an expert's knowledge.

## AO-Star

The AO-Star algorithm is similar to the A-Star algorithm in the sense that it
searches for a solution to a problems

Differences between:

- The AO-star algorithm does not find the most optimal solution
- 

## Alpha Beta Pruning

Alpha-Beta Pruning is a technique used in game-tree search algorithms, such as
min-max, to reduce the number of nodes that need to be evaluated in the search
process. It's a way to optimize the search by avoiding unnecessary exploration
of branches that are known to be worse than previously examined branches.

Alpha-Beta works as follows:

1. Min-max Algorithm:

2. Evaluation Function:

3. Alpha-Beta Pruning:

4. Pruning:

5. Optimization:

Overall, Alpha-Beta pruning is a powerful optimization technique that allows
game-playing algorithms to search more efficiently through a game tree, enabling
them to make decisions more quickly and effectively.
