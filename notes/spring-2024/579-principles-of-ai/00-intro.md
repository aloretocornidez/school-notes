# ECE 579 | AI: A Brief Primer (in the context of ECE 479/579)

## What is AI?

Artificial Intelligence is when an answer that the computer computes is
indistinguishable from that which gives an answer and possesses conciousness.

## The Turing Test

Are the answers that I'm getting with my interactions from the machine
indistinguishable from human answers?

## Attributes of Intelligence

Humans, who possess intelligence:

    - Perceive things and events.
    - Have mental states.
    - Learn.
    - Use language.
    - Make and use models.

AI systems typically posses intelligence in isolated forms:

    - Neural nets
    - Planners
    - etc.

## What can we do with AI?

- AI is a tool that makes a computer better at carrying out their tasks.

Example:
[Traveling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)

- Travel to every city at least once, ideally spending the least amount of
  resources doing so.

Nowadays the perception is that we can calculate this sort of problem with the
computers of today (iPhones, etc.)

Sure, we could throw our terabytes of data and wait two days for an answer
(especially when we need the data quick, such as when we're navigating). But AI
can help us solve these problems in a relatively short time.

## Selected Topics in Class

- State space-based search
- Knowledge representation
- Logic
- Model-based reasoning
- Planning
- Open problems (active student project participation)

## Non-Trivial Example Problems

We would like to reconfigure the 8-puzzle toy so that the tiles are ordered as
shown on the right.

**How would you do this?**

We would have to come up with a representation to allow us to employ the use of
an algorithm. This would allow us to find out how to reach the goal. The next
step is a bit more difficult, we may have to find out a proper strategy.

Using **State Space** based approaches would allow us to approach a situation.

## Types of Artificial Intelligence

The artificial agents that we build perceive the environment and take action
that correspond to the environment.
