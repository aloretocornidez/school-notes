Follow all the steps in threat modeling (except step 4: validate), identify 5 potential threats, apply STRIDE, and DREAD models, identify the impacted assets, and impacted entry points, and describe the mitigation strategy to handle each threat. Use the following tables as guidelines.




**Threat Identification and Categorization (STRIDE) **

1. Footage from the security camera may be harvested without user authorization.
2. Malicious commands may be sent to any of the 'smart' devices that are contained within the home.
3. Data that is transmitted via the internet may be harvested without user authorization.
4. A malicious actor may gain access to the information contained within the mobile device used to control the smart hardware.
5. Each of the pieces of smart hardware could have commands sent to them that causes them to perform self-destructive actions.
6. Malicious actor may cause the house to ignore the homeowner's commands or remove the owner from trusted devices.
