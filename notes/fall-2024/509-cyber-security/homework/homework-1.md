Follow all the steps in threat modeling (except step 4: validate), identify 5 potential threats, apply STRIDE, and DREAD models, identify the impacted assets, and impacted entry points, and describe the mitigation strategy to handle each threat. Use the following tables as guidelines.




**Threat Identification and Categorization (STRIDE) **

| Threat Description                                                                                                          | Spoofing | Tampering | Repudiation | Information Disclosure | Denial of Service | Elevation of Privileges |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| Footage from the security camera may be harvested without user authorization.                                               |          |           | X           | X                      |                   |                         |
| Malicious commands may be sent to any of the 'smart' devices that are contained within the home.                            | X        | X         |             |                        |                   |                         |

| A malicious actor may gain access to the information contained within the mobile device used to control the smart hardware. | X        | X         |             |                        |                   |                         |
| Each of the pieces of smart hardware could have commands sent to them that causes them to perform self-destructive actions. | X        | X         |             |                        | X                 |                         |
| Malicious actor may cause the house to ignore the homeowner's commands or remove the owner from trusted devices.            | X        |           |             |                        | X                 | X                       |
