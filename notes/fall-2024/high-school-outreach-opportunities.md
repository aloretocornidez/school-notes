## High School Outreach Opportunities

### Engineering Student Panel Discussion 

- Have a panel of 4 - 5 (More is possible) engineering students come speak to the high students about college as an engineer.
	- I can bring students from the `Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers` to speak to the students.
	- The `Engineering Ambassadors` can also come to speak to students if that is beneficial as well.

Do you have a tentative date that would work?  **Tentative Date?** 


## Set Up Tables During High School Events 

The College of Engineering can have recruiters set up a table during one of the high school events (especially the ones that involve parents) This is a great way to show that:
1. The university is there to support Alta Vista High School.
2. The students at AVHS have same opportunities available to them in the college-track.

The inclusion of other colleges would also be possible (Business and other non-engineering stem-majors)

## Information Sessions 

- Who should go to college? (STEM vs Non-Stem, financially beneficial degree paths)
- What should one study if they go to college?
- What scholarships are available to students? (Especially with the younger students).
-  Cost of college. How can the parents help their children succeed?
    - Tuition Prices
    - Funding Opportunities (Scholarships, Federal Work Study, Tuition Reduction)
