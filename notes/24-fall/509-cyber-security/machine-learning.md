# Machine Learning

## Common Types of Mahine Learning

- Supervised
  - Training data includes desired outputs.
- Unsupervised
  - Training data does not include desired outputs.
- Semi-supervised
  - Training data includes a few desired outputs.
- Reinformecemnt Learning
  - Rewards froma a sequence of actions.

## The Machine Learning Approach

- Difficulties of hard-coded approach sugges:

  - Allow computers to learn from experience

- First, determine what features to use
  - Too few:
  - Too many: the model is over fitted.
- Learn to map the features to outputs.

1. Generalization (Training)
   - Data collection: Samples
   - Medel selection: Probability dristribution to model process Parameter
     estimation: Values/distribution
2. Decision (Inference of Testing)
   - Inference: Find Responses to queries

## Types of Machine Learning | Explained

### Supervised Learning

- Most wideley used methods of ML
  - Spam detection of email
  - User Authentication system
- Inputs can be vectors or more complex objects
  - Text, images, audio
- Outputs can be different Types
  - Binary, multiclass
  - Multi-label (more than one class), ranking
  - Structured
  - Real0valued a or a mixture of discrete and real-valued

### Unsupervised Learning

- Unlabeled data assuming an underlying structure

1. Clustering to find a partition of data
2. Anomaly detection to find anomalies
3. Identify a low-dimensional manifold
   - PCA, Autoencoder
4. Topic Modeling
   - Topics are distributions over words.

### Shallow Learning

- Type of machine learning that uses relatively simple models to learn from data
- Shallow learning models typically only have only one or two layers of
  processing
- Often used for supervised learning tasks, such as classification and
  regression
- Shallow learnign algorithms include logistic and linear regression, decision
  trees, SVMs

### Deep Learning

- Uses artificial neural networks to learn from data 
- Deep learning models typically have many layers of processing, which allows them to learn cmoplex relationships between the features of the data 
- Often used for supervised learning tasks, such as image classification, matural language processing, and machine translation. 
- Some deep learning models: 
    - Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
    - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
    - Generative adversarial networks (GANs)
