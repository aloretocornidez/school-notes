# Why are People Bilingual
Date: January 11th

Reasons for Bilingualism
- Language Contact
- Language Policies
- Movement of people/immigration
- Trade/Business/Military
- Refugees
- Education and Culture
- Jobs and Professions
- People hard of hearing/deaf


Myths about Language Fluency
- Fluency is only linguistic/grammatical
- You can't speak a language until you are fluent.

Criteria for describing bilinguals & L2 Learners
- Use
- Need (or lack thereof)
- Fluency/Proficiency
- Which languages
- What languages are used for (domains)
- Language History/Development
- Language mode (level of activation of languages)
- Being Bi-cultural too?

Describing Bilinguals in terms of language use and fluency.
- X-Axis: Language Fluency
- Y-Axis: Language Use

What are more objective ways to assess language use and proficiency?
- Language Use
	- Speech Recording
- Language Proficiency
	- Standardized language exams


More things to know and consider about bilinguals
- Typo-logical relationship between languages used
- Languages in the process of acquisition/restructuring
- Language history/acquisition sequence
	- At what age?
	- Where was the language acquired?
	- Simultaneously or sequentially?
- In which contexts (domains) are languages used?
- For what purpose?




Languages in the World
- Estimated 7,000 languages worldwide
- Approx 345 languages are spoken by 95% of the population.

Estimates of rates of bilingualism
- Europe: 56%
- Canada: 18%
- USA: 13.7% - 17% (in 2000)
- Often, small countries has more bilingualism.

# The Functions of Languages, Language Mode, and Choice
Date: January 13th

## Klingon
Is it a natural human language?

Dr. Peter Ecke (Professor) says:
- Not a (natural human) language in all its complexity.
- Not acquired (& further developed) by children.
- Language
	- a complex system acquired, maintained and used by humans to communicate.
	- passed onto next generations who develop it further.

### Language Mode and Language Switching






# Lecture 3 | Code-switching and Borrowing
Date: January 16th

Language Choice is based on:
- Participants of the conversation
	- Speaker relationships
	- Language history between participants
	- Cues (a person's look, dress.)
	- Attitudes towards the culture
- Situation
	- Location
	- Formal-informal
	- Presence of monolinguals
- Content of Discourse
	- School, research, family, hobbies...
- Function of the Interaction
	- Include/exclude others
	- Raise one's social status
	- Commands, requests, apologies, curses etc.


## Codeswitching
- Alternate use of 2 languages
- Speaker makes complete shift to another language for a word, phrase, or sentence and then reverts back to the base language.
- Myth: 'Bilinguals codeswitch out of pure laziness'
- Often stigmatized behaviour, but it is rule-governed and structured complex speech
- There is no uncontrolled, totally confused switching.

Video | Switching languages, accents, and personalities (Matthew and Luca)

### Inter-sentential code-switching
Switching after a sentence is completed.

### Intra-sentential code-switching
Switching within a sentence.


## Why do People Code-switch?
- Better expressed notions in another language
	- More precise, more economical
	- Quoting someone
- Linguistic Need
	- No other word available or more easily accessible
- For social reasons
	- Group identity, inclusion/exclusion of others, emphasis, showing solidarity or gratitude, status.


## Borrowing
- Integration of one language structure into another
- Borrowed words can become a loanword
	- If integrated/acepted in the other language
	- Adapting it morphologically and often phonologically
	- Loanshift
		- if the meaning changes
		- ex. Handy
			- What does the German word Handy mean?
				- Cellphone

## Interference
*When my Spanish interferes with my English or vice-versa*
- Influence of the deactivated, non-intended language on the target language
	- Phonological level (pronunciation, accent)
	- Morphological Level (grammar, endings, prepositions)
	- Lexical level (word choice or comprehension)
	- Syntactic level (word order)
	- Semantic level (meaning)
- Transfer, cross-linguistic influence
- Different from other (intra-language) deviations
	- Over-generalization, simplification, avoidance, hyper-correction.



### Which language influences the other?
*Direction of cross-linguistic influence (CLI)*
- Mostly from dominant language to weaker languages (L1 to L2)
- Bidirectional transfer if both languages are equally strong
- Cases of trilinguals are interesting (L1, L2, L3)
- Factors for CLI:
	- Typological similarity language pairs/triplets
	- Foreign language status
	- Proficiency level.

Potential employment opportunities
Working on bilingual speech recognition/processing

Next Time:
	- Having an accent in a language and Languages accros the lifespan.
