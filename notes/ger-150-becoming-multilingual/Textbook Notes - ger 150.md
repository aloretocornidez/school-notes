This contains useful information that I gather from the readings in [[Lecture Notes - ger 150]].

## Chapter 1 | Bilingual Adults

**Summary**: This chapter looks at the factors that lead to bilingualism, and at how extensive bilingualism really is.

Definition of "Bilingual"
	- Bilinguals are those who use two or more languages (or dialects) in their everyday lives.

Three Points made with regard to this definition.
1. Puts the emphasis of regular use of languages and not on fluency.
2. Includes dialects along with languages.
3. Includes two or more languages as some people speck three or four languages.

Why not use the word 'multilingual'?
- Some people are 'only' bilingual
- The word 'multilingual' is used less than 'bilingual' in reference to individuals.

Languages in the World
	- 7,000 Languages in the world
	- Europe: 239 Languages
	- Asia: 2,269 Languages
	- Pacific Islands: 

Larger Countries are usually more monolingual whereas, smaller countries usually contain more language diversity.

## Chapter 2 | Describing Bilinguals

**Summary**: How can we define what constitutes as a bilingual? This question is addressed in this chapter.

Criteria that Constitutes a Bilingual?
	- Equally fluent in two languages?
	- Growing up with two languages?
	- Incorporating the regular use of two or more languages.

### Language Fluency or Language Use?
- Nancy Huston states: True bilinguals are those who learn to master two languages in early childhood and who can move back and forth between them smoothly and effortlessly.
- Leonard Bloomfield states that bilingualism was the native-like control of two languages.
- Christophe Thiery states: A true bilingual is someone who is taken to be one of themselves by the members of two different linguistic communities at roughly the same social and cultural level.

## Chapter 3 | The Functions of Languages
### What Languages are Used For
#ComplementarityPrinciple #definition
Complementarity Principle: 
Bilinguals usually acquire and use their languages for different purposes, in different domains of life, with different people. Different aspects of life often require different languages

#Diglossia
Diglossia:
Where two languages or two varieties of a language are employed by a group, each language has a very precise domain of use.

- Different Languages Cover Different Domains of Life
	- The reason to be bilingual is because it is uncommon that a single language covers all domains of life. 

### The Impact of the Complementarity Principle
- **Language Fluency**
	- If a language is spoken in a reduced number of domains and with a limited number of people, it will not be developed as well.
		- This can occur in speaking, writing, and reading.
	-  Borrowing is 2x-5x more common when someone is speaking with another bilingual.
	- Fluency in a language can be different depending on the domain of what you're speaking (i.e. statistics in french vs statistics in english).
- **Language Dominance**
	- People may have a language that is dominant in general over the other languages.
	- Language dominance may also be different depending on the domains in which they are used. If someone uses Language A in one domain and Language B in another domain, the person may be dominance in each of the respective domains.
- **Translation**
	- *Myth: Bilinguals are born translators.*
	- Bilinguals' lack of translation skills can be explained by means of the complementarity principle.
	- Unless the person has a domain of both languages covered in their language knowledge, translation may be difficult. 
- **Memory**
	- Bilinguals remember things better when the language that is used for recall matches the language that is used at the time of the event in a particular event. (ex. Aneta Pavlenko: . When asked, in Russian, for her apartment number in the United States, she erroneously provided the number of her old apartment in her native country, which she knew in Russian)
	- Bilinguals are more likely to retrieve events (memories) that occurred in a particular language if that same language is also used in the retrieval setting.

The complementarity principle is certainly one of the most pervasive aspects of individual bilingualism. Bilinguals who speak two  or more languages feel its constant presence in their everyday lives.  They may even comment openly on its different manifestations,  without finding the exact words to account for them.

## Chapter 4 | Language Mode and Language Choice

Bilinguals must ask themselves two questions:
1. Language Choice | Which language should they use?
2. Can they bring other languages into the interaction if they need to?

### Language Mode
- Monolingual Mode
	- Monolingual mode is used if a bilingual person is speaking a languages with a monolingual.
- Bilingual Mode
	- Bilingual mode is used if a bilingual is talking to another bilingual and they feel confident that they can bring in another language.
 - Intermediary Mode
	 - A point in between monolingual and bilingual mode, there is a continuum and many situations can cause this intermediary mode, such as:
		 - When their interlocutor is bilingual but does not like to bring in the other language during a conversation.
		 - When they are talking  about a subject in the “wrong” language (their other language is  probably activated in such a situation, even if they do not use it).
Bilinguals differ from one another in terms of how much they move along the language-mode continuum.

Though someone is in 'mono-lingual' mode, the other languages may still be activated, such as grammatical rules from different languages. (English and Spanish in my case.)

**Trilingual Mode**
The same case can be made where different languages are activated to different degrees with three or more languages.

### Base Languages
A base language must first be chosen when bilinguals are speaking to each other.

A Yaqui Indian may know Yaqui, Spanish, and English. How does he select which language to use with who?

Reasons for choosing a base language can include:
	- Master of the language of both bilinuguals
	- Members of a stigmatized community may not want to speak a language
		- ex. German Jews after WWII not speaking German
	- Age
	- Socioeconomic status, degree of intimacy
	- Situation
		- The situation, or location, of an interaction can also determine what language is used.
	- Formality
		- 


**Bilinguals who deal extensively with the public develop a finely tuned sense for determining what language to use** based on the person's:
	- Stance 
	- Dress
	- Facial Expression
'and they are often right.'


## Chapter 5 | Code-Switching and Borrowing
Code-switching is the alternate use of two languages, that is, the speaker makes a shift to another language for a word, phrase, or sentence, then reverts back to the base language.


*Myth: Bilinguals code-switch out of pure laziness.*

Code-switching has been given pejorative names such as Franglais (English and French) and Tex-Mex or Spanglish (English and Spanish).

Bilinguals code-switch for multiple reasons: 
1. Some notions are better expressed in the other language.
	- the word or expression in the other language adds a little something that is more precise than trying to find an equivalent element in the base language
2. Fill a linguistic need for a word or an expression.
	- Words like 'day care center', 'finger food', 'window shopping', and 'pot-luck dinners' need multiple words to convey in french.
3. To report what someone has said in the other language.
	- It would sound unnatural to translate it for a bilingual who understands the other language perfectly.
4. Used as a communicative or social strategy
	- To show speaker involvement
	- Mark group identity
	- Exclude someone
	- Raise one's status

> "Code-switching is a verbal skill requiring a large degree of  linguistic competence in more than one language, rather than a defect arising from insufficient knowledge of one or the other"
\- Shana Poplack

### Borrowing
Unlike code-switching, borrowing is the integration of one language into another.

### Reasons for borrowing
The reasons for borrowing words from a language are very similar to the reasons given for code-switching.

When spontaneous borrowings become established borrowings, they have not only gone through an integration process but have also survived the resistance of some of the speakers of the language concerned.

The opposition to loans from other languages is not something new, and it has not always worked in the same direction.
*French used to affect English, now it is the other way around with words like cool, top, etc.*

## Chapter 6 | Speaking and Writing Monolingually
When communicating with others, bilinguals are constantly asking themselves -- subconsciously most of the time -- which language they should use and whether they can bring in another language.

The answer is apparently quite simple: they will have to use the language the others know, and, if possible, they will not let another language intervene.

### Choosing a Language
At first sight, choosing a language for communicating in a mono-lingual mode appears to be a simple operation. We 'shut off' out other language\[s] and speak just one.

Bilinguals who manage to stay in a monolingual mode and, in addition, who speak that language fluently and have no accent in it, can often 'pass' as monolinguals.

Sometimes more than communication is at stake, and keeping to the monolingual mode is all the more crucial.
For example: a person needing to maintain a hidden nationality in a war.

**Inhibition of a language vs deactivation**
### Code-Switching in a Monolingual Mode
One reason for code-switching in a monolingual mode is to bring in a proper noun from the other language.
