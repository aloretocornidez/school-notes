This contains useful information that I gather from the readings in [[Lecture Notes - ger 150]].

# Chapter 1 | Bilingual Adults

**Summary**: This chapter looks at the factors that lead to bilingualism, and at how extensive bilingualism really is.

Definition of "Bilingual"
	- Bilinguals are those who use two or more languages (or dialects) in their everyday lives.

Three Points made with regard to this definition.
1. Puts the emphasis of regular use of languages and not on fluency.
2. Includes dialects along with languages.
3. Includes two or more languages as some people speck three or four languages.

Why not use the word 'multilingual'?
- Some people are 'only' bilingual
- The word 'multilingual' is used less than 'bilingual' in reference to individuals.

Languages in the World
	- 7,000 Languages in the world
	- Europe: 239 Languages
	- Asia: 2,269 Languages
	- Pacific Islands: 

Larger Countries are usually more monolingual whereas, smaller countries usually contain more language diversity.

# Chapter 2 | Describing Bilinguals

**Summary**: How can we define what constitutes as a bilingual? This question is addressed in this chapter.

Criteria that Constitutes a Bilingual?
	- Equally fluent in two languages?
	- Growing up with two languages?
	- Incorporating the regular use of two or more languages.

### Language Fluency or Language Use?
- Nancy Huston states: True bilinguals are those who learn to master two languages in early childhood and who can move back and forth between them smoothly and effortlessly.
- Leonard Bloomfield states that bilingualism was the native-like control of two languages.
- Christophe Thiery states: A true bilingual is someone who is taken to be one of themselves by the members of two different linguistic communities at roughly the same social and cultural level.

# Chapter 3 | The Functions of Languages
### What Languages are Used For
#ComplementarityPrinciple #definition
Complementarity Principle: 
Bilinguals usually acquire and use their languages for different purposes, in different domains of life, with different people. Different aspects of life often require different languages

#Diglossia
Diglossia:
Where two languages or two varieties of a language are employed by a group, each language has a very precise domain of use.

- Different Languages Cover Different Domains of Life
	- The reason to be bilingual is because it is uncommon that a single language covers all domains of life. 

### The Impact of the Complementarity Principle
- **Language Fluency**
	- If a language is spoken in a reduced number of domains and with a limited number of people, it will not be developed as well.
		- This can occur in speaking, writing, and reading.
	-  Borrowing is 2x-5x more common when someone is speaking with another bilingual.
	- Fluency in a language can be different depending on the domain of what you're speaking (i.e. statistics in french vs statistics in english).
- **Language Dominance**
	- People may have a language that is dominant in general over the other languages.
	- Language dominance may also be different depending on the domains in which they are used. If someone uses Language A in one domain and Language B in another domain, the person may be dominance in each of the respective domains.
- **Translation**
	- *Myth: Bilinguals are born translators.*
	- Bilinguals' lack of translation skills can be explained by means of the complementarity principle.
	- Unless the person has a domain of both languages covered in their language knowledge, translation may be difficult. 
- **Memory**
	- Bilinguals remember things better when the language that is used for recall matches the language that is used at the time of the event in a particular event. (ex. Aneta Pavlenko: . When asked, in Russian, for her apartment number in the United States, she erroneously provided the number of her old apartment in her native country, which she knew in Russian)
	- Bilinguals are more likely to retrieve events (memories) that occurred in a particular language if that same language is also used in the retrieval setting.

The complementarity principle is certainly one of the most pervasive aspects of individual bilingualism. Bilinguals who speak two  or more languages feel its constant presence in their everyday lives.  They may even comment openly on its different manifestations,  without finding the exact words to account for them.

# Chapter 4 | Language Mode and Language Choice

Bilinguals must ask themselves two questions:
1. Language Choice | Which language should they use?
2. Can they bring other languages into the interaction if they need to?

### Language Mode
- Monolingual Mode
	- Monolingual mode is used if a bilingual person is speaking a languages with a monolingual.
- Bilingual Mode
	- Bilingual mode is used if a bilingual is talking to another bilingual and they feel confident that they can bring in another language.
 - Intermediary Mode
	 - A point in between monolingual and bilingual mode, there is a continuum and many situations can cause this intermediary mode, such as:
		 - When their interlocutor is bilingual but does not like to bring in the other language during a conversation.
		 - When they are talking  about a subject in the “wrong” language (their other language is  probably activated in such a situation, even if they do not use it).
Bilinguals differ from one another in terms of how much they move along the language-mode continuum.

Though someone is in 'mono-lingual' mode, the other languages may still be activated, such as grammatical rules from different languages. (English and Spanish in my case.)

**Trilingual Mode**
The same case can be made where different languages are activated to different degrees with three or more languages.

### Base Languages
A base language must first be chosen when bilinguals are speaking to each other.

A Yaqui Indian may know Yaqui, Spanish, and English. How does he select which language to use with who?

Reasons for choosing a base language can include:
	- Master of the language of both bilinuguals
	- Members of a stigmatized community may not want to speak a language
		- ex. German Jews after WWII not speaking German
	- Age
	- Socioeconomic status, degree of intimacy
	- Situation
		- The situation, or location, of an interaction can also determine what language is used.
	- Formality
		- 


**Bilinguals who deal extensively with the public develop a finely tuned sense for determining what language to use** based on the person's:
	- Stance 
	- Dress
	- Facial Expression
'and they are often right.'


# Chapter 5 | Code-Switching and Borrowing
Code-switching is the alternate use of two languages, that is, the speaker makes a shift to another language for a word, phrase, or sentence, then reverts back to the base language.


*Myth: Bilinguals code-switch out of pure laziness.*

Code-switching has been given pejorative names such as Franglais (English and French) and Tex-Mex or Spanglish (English and Spanish).

Bilinguals code-switch for multiple reasons: 
1. Some notions are better expressed in the other language.
	- the word or expression in the other language adds a little something that is more precise than trying to find an equivalent element in the base language
2. Fill a linguistic need for a word or an expression.
	- Words like 'day care center', 'finger food', 'window shopping', and 'pot-luck dinners' need multiple words to convey in french.
3. To report what someone has said in the other language.
	- It would sound unnatural to translate it for a bilingual who understands the other language perfectly.
4. Used as a communicative or social strategy
	- To show speaker involvement
	- Mark group identity
	- Exclude someone
	- Raise one's status

> "Code-switching is a verbal skill requiring a large degree of  linguistic competence in more than one language, rather than a defect arising from insufficient knowledge of one or the other"
\- Shana Poplack

### Borrowing
Unlike code-switching, borrowing is the integration of one language into another.

![[Screenshot_20230116_184550.png]]

### Reasons for borrowing
The reasons for borrowing words from a language are very similar to the reasons given for code-switching.

When spontaneous borrowings become established borrowings, they have not only gone through an integration process but have also survived the resistance of some of the speakers of the language concerned.

The opposition to loans from other languages is not something new, and it has not always worked in the same direction.
*French used to affect English, now it is the other way around with words like cool, top, etc.*

# Chapter 6 | Speaking and Writing Monolingually
When communicating with others, bilinguals are constantly asking themselves -- subconsciously most of the time -- which language they should use and whether they can bring in another language.

The answer is apparently quite simple: they will have to use the language the others know, and, if possible, they will not let another language intervene.

### Choosing a Language
At first sight, choosing a language for communicating in a mono-lingual mode appears to be a simple operation. We 'shut off' out other language\[s] and speak just one.

Bilinguals who manage to stay in a monolingual mode and, in addition, who speak that language fluently and have no accent in it, can often 'pass' as monolinguals.

Sometimes more than communication is at stake, and keeping to the monolingual mode is all the more crucial.
For example: a person needing to maintain a hidden nationality in a war.

**Inhibition of a language vs deactivation**
### Code-Switching in a Monolingual Mode
One reason for code-switching in a monolingual mode is to bring in a proper noun from the other language.

> I once heard an American professor say  on a French radio program during an interview, “Il n’est pas ruthless” (He’s not ruthless). The reporter, who wanted the interview to be understandable to the listeners, came in immediately with the French expression, “sans scrupules.” The professor said, “Oui . . .”  and then continued what he had been saying.

### Interferences
Despite the fact that bilinguals sometimes want to keep out their other languages when they are speaking or writing monolingually, and although they may have filtered out all code-switches, the other languages can still enter in the form of interferences: deviations from the language being spoken (or written) stemming form the influence of the deactivated languages.

Interferences, also called 'transfers', accompany bilinguals throughout their life, however hard they try to avoid them. 

They are a bilingual's 'hidden companions,' often present even though one tries to filter them out.

#### Kinds of interferences
- **Static Inferences** | reflect permanent traces of one language on the other
	- Such as a permanent accent
	- The meaning of extensions of particular words
	- Specific syntactic structures
	- etc.
- **Dynamic Interferences** | Ephemeral intrusions of the other language
	- An accidental slip on the stress pattern of a word due to the stress rules of the other language
	- The momentary use of a syntactic structure taken from the language, or languages not being spoken.

Usually the types are difficult to differentiate -- Except in the case of an accent, which is most often a static interference.

The discussion will emphasize dynamic interferences -- elements of the  other language that sliup into the language you are speaking or writing, most often without your being aware of them.

Often, it is only when your interlocutor asks what you meant by word ```X``` or corrects your syntax or looks at you in a strange way that you realize, after the fact, that the other language has slipped in.

You are often left with the feeling that you were *sure* that ```X``` was a word in that language, or that the structure was correct, when in fact that was not the case. 

### Levels of Interferences
1. Pronunciation (Phonology, Prosody) | Foreign Accent
	- Traces of an accent can be 
		- Permanent
			- The accent you have when speaking language ```X```
		- Ephemeral
			- Wrong stress placement on a word
			- The intonation of a phrase Based on your stronger language
			- etc.

2. Word Level
	Possibly using false cognates, like 'embarazado' when telling someone you're embarrassed.

3. Idiomatic Expressions and Proverbs
	"I'm telling myself stories" in french is like saying "I'm kidding myself.

4. Syntactic Level
	Word order such as the order of adjectives and nouns in English and Spanish.

### Interferences and Communication
Interferences bilinguals produce when communicating in a single language can have different impacts on the comprehension of their monolingual listeners.

- Interference pattern is possible in the base language ans has no negative impact on comprehension.
	- Word order in particular English --> Russian sentences.
	- Grammar is correct but additional words/word order are not necessary.
- The meaning of the sentence is understandable by implication.
	- German-English bilingual 'yesterday he came to be' based on the German, "gestern kam er."
	- The sentence is not gramatically correct but the meaning can be understood.
- Interference produces an unintended meaning and hence communication is affected.
	- 'Je te manque' (FR) based on 'I miss you' (EN)
	- The person is understood to be saying 'You miss me' instead of 'I miss you', they should have said 'Tu me manques' (FR)


### Final point on the direction of Interferences
If bilinguals are heavily dominant in a language, then the interference flow is straightforward: the stringer language influences the weaker language, either in a permanent manner, or in an ephemeral way.

However, if the two languages have more or less equal importance (at least in everyday use), then interferences can go both ways.


The bilingual is not the sum of two (or more) complete or incomplete monolinguals; rather, he or she has a unique and specific linguistic configuration. The coexistence and constant interaction of the languages in the bilingual 

# Chapter 7 | Having an Accent in a Language
*Myth: Real bilinguals have no accent in their different languages.*

Whether one has an accent is mainly dependent on when the language was acquired.
Having an accent does not make someone less or more bilingual.
There is no relationship between one's knowledge of a language and whether one has an accent in it.

### An Accent: Why and How
Reasons why one may have an accent.
1. One has acquired a particular dialect of the language.
	- An English speaker from India may simply have the accent linked to Indian English and it may have nothing to do with the age at which his English was acquired.
2. The influence of one's first language on the second.
	- An English-French bilingual may have an English accent in French because she acquired French later on in life.
	- Some sounds in a language may not be found in another language, thus, phonetic replacements are made. 'Rosses' vs 'Roses' due to the lack of a 'z' sound in norwegian.
3. The influence of one's second language on the first.
	- The same can occur in reverse.
4. A bilingual should can have an accent in all of his or her languages.

There is dispute among scholars on how age determines whether or not a person will have an accent in a particular language. Before 6 years old is the sensitive period, some say that the window stays open until age 12, there are however, accounts of people who learn a language past that age ans are 'accent-less'

All language is accented by definition, though not in the sense used here.


### Disadvantages and Advantages of Having an Accent
- An accent may make you stick out, when in fact, you want the opposite, to blend in.
- As an adult, if one's accent is strong, and the society is not positively inclined toward the group you belong to, an accent can have a negative effect on the way you are perceived and treated.
- Having an accent may also give the wrong impression -- that the speaker does not know the language, in spite of the speaker knowing that language well.
- Intelligibility may suffer if the accent is too strong and conversations may be cut short.
- Stress and emotion can make an accent reappear or increase in strength.
- An accent clearly marks you as a member of your group. Some people do not want to be seen as belonging to the other language group and purposely use their accent as a signal of their original group membership.
- Having an accent can be self-protective: it prevents members of the group you are interacting with from expecting you to know all the group's cultural and social rules. In short, it allows you to be different.

To Summarize, having an accent does not not make you any less bilingual and rarely impedes communication. 



# Chapter 8 | Languages across the Lifespan

Examining how languages wax and wane during a lifetime, which may well include the learning of new languages and the forgetting of older ones, is very much part of understanding the bilingual person.

### The Wax and Wane of Languages
Individual language history can be quite complex.
Important life events may change the relative importance of their languages
- Starting School
- Settling down with a spouse
- Losing a close family member with whom a language was used exclusively

New needs will change the bilingual person's language configurations (Complementarity principle)


Global Dominance in a language can change. The bilingual's first language is not automatically the stronger language at a particular point in time.

*Myth: Real bilinguals acquire their two or more languages in childhood.*

One can become bilingual in childhood, but also in adolescence and in adulthood.

### Language Forgetting
Changes in life, such as immigration or the loss of a close family member may be the start of what is referred to as language loss or language attrition.

When a person loses their previously dominant language, one may feel remorse or regret.
	- 'I should have kept up my X'



### Bilinugalism and the Elderly
As the years move on, bilinguals sometimes ask themselves whaty the status oftheir language knowledge and use will be in old age, especially in their second language.


> We’re sometimes filled with dread at the perspective of a  quasi-autistic communal old age. At first our acquired language will desert us bit by bit and our sentences will be studded with blanks: ‘Could you get me the . . . ? You know, the thing that’s hanging from the . . . in the . . . ??!’ . . . Eventually, with French totally erased from our memories, we shall sit in our rocking-chairs from dawn to dusk, nattering incomprehensibly in our respective  mother tongues
> \- Nancy Huston


- Being bilingual may well delay the development of dementia in old age.

- Growing old as a bilingual does not seem to be very different from growing old as a monolingual, with its advantages and disadvantages; it may just be, though, that bilinguals have a few additional cognitive benefits in their favor.



# Chapter 9 | Attitudes and Feelings about Bilingualism

### How Bilinguals View the Advantages of Bilingualism

- Bilingualism allows you to interact with many different people, it is also true that if you do not sufficiently know a language, communication can be difficult.
- Knowing several languages helps you learn other languages.
- Bilingualism also seems to encourage divergent thinking.
>Bilinguals were superior in divergent thinking tasks that require the ability to simultaneously activate and process multiple unrelated concepts from distant categories... the one area in which they behaved identically to monolinguals was originality, that is, the ability to produce uncommon ideas or ideas that are totally new or unique.

- Bilingualism may lead to more job opportunities and greater social mobility.
- Allows one to help others
- Creates a bond with other bilinguals. 

### How Bilinguals View the Inconveniences of Bilingualism
The disadvantages are less numerous than the advantages (according to many bilinguals)
- Bilinguals who do not know their language well report that they get tired and frustrated of having to use it and they invariable make mistakes when doing so.
- Bilinguals are concerned about the effects of their stronger language on a weaker one. 
- Switching to the languages that are required in that environment can be cumbersome, such as speaking publicly in the weaker language)
- Bilinguals are often asked to be interpreters or translators.
- Some bilinguals who are also bicultural do not feel they belong to any cultural group. They feel estranged from their cultures, particularly at turning points in their lives.

### Bilingualism as Seen by Monolinguals
Attitudes of monolinguals on bilinguals can range form very positive to very negative.




# Chapter 10 | Bilinguals Who Are Also Bicultural
*Myth: Bilinguals are also bicultural*

### Describing Bicultural people.
1. They take part, to varying degrees, in the life of two or more cultures.
2. The adapt, at least in part, their attitudes, behavior, values, and languages to their cultures.
3. The combine and blend aspects of the cultures involved.
	1. An example would be facial expressions and body language.


![[Pasted image 20230120112949.png]]

### Acting Biculturaly
When a bilingual interacts with monolinguals, many times, only one culture is shown.

When a bilingual is interacting with another bilingual and they have a shared culture, many times, a base culture is shown. 



### The Bilingual's Identity
Their dilemma is that monocultural members of their different cultures want to know if they are members of culture A or culture B, or of a new culture, when biculturals just want to be accepted -- consciously or unconsciously -- for who they are: members of two or more cultures.


# Chapter 11 | Personality, Thinking and Dreaming, and Emotions in Bilinguals

### The Personality of Bilinguals

*Myth: Bilinguals have double or split personalities.*

**Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) Cards Experiment**
- Cards that show ambiguous content.
- Two Sessions, six-weeks apart, two languages.
- Language Affected three variables:
	- Verbal Aggression towards peers
	- Withdrawal-autonomy
	- Achievement

> I don't really know if my personality changes when I change language. The main reason for this uncertainty is that I use the two languages in different situations and therefore would act differently even if it was in the same language.

In other words, it is the environment and the interlocutors together that cause bi-cultural bilinguals to change attitudes, feelings and behaviors (along with language)-and not their language as such.

### Thinking and Dreaming in Bilinguals

- When bilinguals were surveyed, they answered that they think in both languages (70% said this)
- They may have taken their 'inner speech' and 'internal monologues' into consideration when giving their answer.

Do thoughts have a language? (mentalese) Some people say that thoughts are visual-spatial before they are translated to a language. There are many opponents to this (What if you are told to think of an object, obviously you must think about a banana after being told to think about a banana).


### Emotions in Bilinguals
*Myth: Bilinguals express their emotions in their first language, which is usually the language of their parents.*




# Chapter 12 | Bilingual Writers

Many writers decide to stick to one language for writing, usually their first language.

Writing is probably one of the most difficult literary skills that a person can acquire.

1. One reason for writing in multiple languages is to be able to reach a wider audience.
2. Authors are usually not satisfied with the job that external translators do when translating their works.
3. A third reason is because of the complementarity principle. Some words to describe things may not be the best word to use in the context.


# Chapter 13 | Special Bilinguals

### Second-Language Teachers
There are two kinds of second-language teachers
1. Those who teach the country's language to foreigners
2. Those who teach a language that is not the country's main language.

Some do not use the language they teach outside the classroom very often.

They have insights into the linguistics of the language that normal language users do not have. (How many speakers of English can explain, in a pedagogical way, the difference between the prepositions “for,” “since,” and “ago”?)

Language teachers are in bilingual mode when teaching
- They must have another language available whenever a student asks a question that contains code-switches
- The teacher must not rely code-switching themselves.

Teachers rarely believe they themselves are bilingual because they often have a strict view on what it means to be bilingual.

They are usually true admirers of the second language they teach.


### Translators and Interpreters

Unlike regular bilinguals, translators and interpreters must have a complete set of translation equivalents in the other language.

They must also know the two languages fluently (at all linguistic levels)

The must also have a good knowledge of the cultures concerned.

Translators often indicate:
- Which languages they can translate from (source languages)
- Which languages they can translate to (target languages)

Translation is a special bilingual skill: You try to express in one language, in as faithful a way as possible, the meaning and the style of a text in another language.

This means fully understanding the original text in the source language, and having the necessary transfer skills, as well as the linguistic and cultural skills in the target language

There is little room for for a translator's own intuition or creativity. He or she must follow the original text as exactly as possible and render it in correct prose in the target language.


### Secret Agents




# Chapter 14 | In and Out of Bilingualism

### Becoming Bilingual
- Children who acquire two languages are far rarer than children who acquire one language and then another.
- If the environment requires it, children can usually pick up languages very quickly, they can also forget them very quickly.
-

### Reverting to Monolingualism
- Children can forget languages over the course of their life, this can sometimes include the languages of their parents.
- Normally, parents learn enough of the majority language to interact, to some extent at least, with their children who speak it exclusively.

#### An Explanation
The main factor leading to the development of a language is a *need* for that language. The need can be of vaious sorts:
- To communicate with family members, caretakers, friends
- To participate in the activiteis of a day care or a school
- To interact with people in a community
- The need can simply be to watch television, do sports, and so on.

![[Pasted image 20230205133451.png]]

In a word, the child has to feel that he or she really needs a particular language. If that is so, and other factors are favorable, then the child will develop the language. If the need disappears or isn't really there (perhaps the parents also speak the other language but pretend they don't), and other factors are unfavorable, then they child will no longer use the  language and there is a fair chance that it will be forgotten. 

### Factors of 'Picking Up' A Language

1. Children require a certain amount of input of the language in order to acquire it.
2. The type of input that children receive is important.
3. The role of the family
4. Attitude people have toward the language and culture that need support, as well as toward bilingualism.

*Myth: The language spoken in the home will have a negative effect on the acquisition of the school language, when the latter is different.*





# Chapter 15 | Acquiring Two Languages

*Myth: Bilingualism will delay language acquisition in children.*


Language person bonds can exist in young children, where they may not like to address people in another language if the base language has already been established.



*Myth: The earlier a language is acquired, the more fluent a child will be in it.*
1. Children do not have fewer inhibitions and are not less embarrassed when they make mistakes; in fact, they may well be shy and self-conscious in front of their peers.
2. You children are rather unsophisticated and immature learners in that they have not yet fully acquired certain cognitive skills -- such as the capacity to abstract, generalize, infer, and classify -- that could help them in second-language acquisition.
3. The notion that there is a strict, critical period for language learning around the age of five years old has been replaced with the notion of a broader 'sensitive  period' that can extend beyond ten years old and is probably different for different language skills and is probably different for different language skills.

### Wong Fillmore's Model to Learn New Languages

3 Sets of processes
1. Social Aspects
- The learner must figure out what people are talking about and how they do it.
- They also have ot make the speakers aware of their needs and get them to make accommodation and adjustments so that they can understand the speakers.
- Both sides have to cooperate

3 Social strategies used by language learners:
- Join a group and act as if you understand what's going on even if you don't
- Give the impression with a few well-chosen words that you can speak the language
- Count on your friends for help


2. Linguistic Aspects
Learners have to obtain form native speakers information to allow them to discover how the language works and how people use it. 
They get this information from the repetitive, and regular speech that is spoken to them in context by native speakers.
The learners have to pay close attention to what is being said and assume a relationship between that and the events around them. 
They make educated guesses about what people are saying and what they are likely to talk about in a given situation. 
'Assume that what people are saying is directly relevant to the situation at hand or to what they or you are experiencing.'
Learners bring to the task their knowledge of linguistic categories, types of structures (declarative, interrogative, and so on) and speech acts (direct and indirect),  and hence they can look for their equivalents in the new langues.

3. Cognitive Elements
Learners must discover the units and rules of the languea; they must then synthesize this knowladge into a grammar. 
They apply cognitive skills to accomplish this, such as associative and analytical skills, memory, inferntial skills, and so on . 
They also use learning strategies, 'Look for recurring parts in the formaulas you know', 'Make the most of what you've got, 'work on big things, save the details for later'

# Chapter 18 | Effects of Bilingualism on Children

*Myth: Bilingualism has a negative effect on the development of children.*

### Problems with past studies

> If it were possible for a child or boy to live in two languages at once equally well, so much the worse. His intellectual and spiritual growth would not thereby be doubled but halved. Unity of mind and of character would have great difficulty in asserting itself in such circumstances.

\- Simon S. Laurie, 1890


> The brain effort required to master two languages instead of one certainly diminishes the child’s power of learning other things which might and ought to be learnt.

\- Otto Jesperson, ~1920

Many factors contribute to the results of previous studes, first, the bilinguals did much worse than their monolingual counterparts. The samples chosen were not sufficiently compartmentalized into categories such as age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Not to mention, the bilinguals in question may not have had sufficient command of the language they were tested in.

Later studies that showed the opposite, that is, that bilinguals had high IQ, more divergent thought, etc., may have cherry picked the bilinguals that were tested as the researchers had a strict criterion for selection of the individuals. 

### Where do we stand today?

Nowadays, results are not so black and white, if there are differences, they are mostly subtle.


> The picture emerging from these studies is a complex portrait of interactions between bilingualism and skill acquisition in which there are sometimes benefits for bilingual children, sometimes deficits, and sometimes no consequence at all.


### Bilingual Children and Language Disorders

- The percentage of children with language disorders is the same for both monolingual and bilingual students.


> Bilingualism does not cause any type of language disorder and retracting to just one language does not improve a language disorder

\- Döpke



# Chapter 19 | Education and Bilingualism


Bilingual education can be controversial, possibly causing war in some countries.

There are two approaches two bilingual education:
1. When the education aims for bilingualism
2. When the education does not aim for bilingualism

### When the Aim Is Not Bilingualism

Many schools teach a language formally, think of when schools in the United States teach Spanish as another subject. It is not used in other classes as the language that students learn other subjects.

### When the Aim Is Bilingualism
Many programs begin in schooling in the minority language and slowly introduce the home language as the students age. This allows them to pick up a language organically and they do not have any noticeable side effects in main language comprehension skills. 



# Non-Textbook Entries

## How many languages are there in the world? - M. Paul Lewis

What is the difference between a language and a dialect? How do you differentiate between the two?

There are mild divisions between people of different socioeconomic statuses as well. 

How many languages exist also depends on *when* you count the,. They change, grow, and sometimes have offspring and die.

About a quarter of the world's languages have less than 1,000 speakers.

On the other end, there is a smaller group of very dominant large languages that many linguists predict will drive smaller languages to extinction.

In addition to counting the languages in the world, it is also interesting to look at how languages are distributed around the world. 

## Is there a language crisis in the United States? - Julie Tetel Anderson

> "The answer to the question in the title is an unequivocal *yes*"

The United States does not have enough people who speak 'Critical Langauges', that is, languages that are important to United States National Security.

High School level teaching of foreign languages is good but could be better.

Until there is a wide understanding that knowing a foreign language is as important as knowing math, science, and history, progress will not be made.


## Are American Dialects Dying? - Walt Wolfram 

> Is shared popular culture wiping out dialects in the United States? 
> Can new dialects appear in today's world? 
> Do you speak a dialect?

We almost always notice dialects in other speakers, but we rarely notice the dialects that we speak, "we don't speak a dialect, we speak normal English"

Everyone uses different words to describe the same thing.

Sub, grinder, hoagie, hero

## What Makes Some Languages Harder to Learn Than Others? - Barry Hilton

> What makes Chinese so tough to learn?

Linguists will say that every language is complex in some ways and simple in others, they average out to the same amount of complexity.

Rephrasing the question, "Which major language is hardest for native English speakers to learn?" Then a good case can be made for Chinese being a difficult language to learn.


Languages like Spanish, Russian, or Hindi have plenty of english cognates.

Chinese does not have many English cognates.

Another factor that makes Chinese difficult for native English speakers is a phonetic intonation that is not optional.

The Chinese writing system also contributes to the difficulty in learning Chinese for native English speakers.


A character with three squiggles can mean different things depending on how the squiggles are written. 

> It's not hard to imagine that illiteracy is a major problem in China.

It is harder to look up characters in Chinese dictionaries, it is not as simple as mouthing the ABCs while you flip through your dicitonary.




## How Many Languages Can a Person Learn? - Richard Hudson

> What is the most languages anybody has ever mastered?
> Do you have to be abnormal to learn so many?

A typical American or Brit knows exactly one language.


What is the human capacity for language learning? The answer is that no one knows.

*Normal Capacity vs Extreme Capacity*
The amount that an average  person can learn and the maximum a person can learn.

Are languages similar enough that it's not so hard to learn five or six of them? 
In a word, *No*

Some people do not need to learn additional languages because their social circles do not require it. 


Hyper-polyglots can speak about 20-30 languages with some being always available, some requiring a 'brush-up' and others requiring the help of a dictionary.

Interesting fact: Nearly all of the Polyglots surveyed were men.



## Why Are Some People Better At Learning Languages Than Others

People aren't totally on control of when they learn new languages.
