# Depreciation and Income Taxes

### Intro
Raw Cashflows --> Income after Depreciation Expenses --> After-Tax cash Flows (ATCF)--> Use equivalent-worth or rate-of-return methods for evaluation


### Depreciation Concepts and Terminology
* Depreciation is the decrease in value of physical properties with the passage of time and use.
	* MOre specifically, depreciation is an accounting concept that establishes an annual deduction against before-tax income such that the effect and time use on an asset's value can be reflected in a firm's financial statements.
* Depreciation is a non-cash cost that is intended to approximate the yearly fraction of an asset's value used in the production of income.

* A company can begin to depreciate property it owns when the property is placed in service for use in the business and to produce income.
* Depreciation stops when the cost of placing an asset in service has been recovered or when the asset is sold, whichever occurs first.

## Depreciation Methods
### Straight Line Method
Assumes a constant amount of depreciation each year over the depreciable life of the asset.

$$d_{k}= \frac{B - SV_N}{N}$$

$$BV_{k}= B - k(d_{k})$$

### Declining-Balance Method
Assumes a constant-percentage of the remaining BV is depreciated each year.

$$d_{k}= B(1-R)^{k-1}(R)$$

$$BV_{k}=B(1-R)^{k}$$

### DB with Switchover to SL
* DB method never reaches a BV of zero or other specific value such as SVN
* Switch to SL in order to make an assetâ€™s BV reaches a desired value
* Switchover occurs in the year in which an equal or a larger depreciation amount is obtained from the SL method

### Units of Production Method
Can be used when the decrease in value of the asset is mostly a function of use, instead of time.

Cost basis is allocated over the number of units produced over the asset's life.

$$\text{Depreciation\ per\ unit\ of\ production} = \frac{B-SV_{N}}{\text{Estimated lifetime production units}}$$



### Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS)

* Any property that qualifies under GDS, however, can be depreciated under ADS, if elected.
* When  an asset is depreciated using MACRS, the following information needed to calculated deductions:

1. Cost basis, B
2. Date the property was placed into service
3. The property class and recovery period
4. The MACRS depreciation method (GDS or ADS)
5. The time convention that applies (half year)

### MACRS Class Lives and Recovery Periods

1. For tangible personal property, the ADS recovery period is shown in the last column on the right of table 7-2.
2. Any tangible persional property that does not fit into one of teh asset classes is depreciated under a 12-year ADS recovery period.
3. The ADS recovery period for nonresidential real property is 40 years.

Under the GDS, the basic information about peroperty classes and recovery periods is as follows:
1. Most tangible personal property is assigned to one of six personal property classes (3, 5, 7, 10, 15, and 20 year property). The personal property class (in years) is the same as the GDS recovery period.
2. Any depreciable peronal property that dies not fit into one of the defined asset classes is depreciated as being the the seven-year property class.
3. Real property is assiigned to two real peorperty classes: nonresidential real property and residential rental property.

### Time convention
* A half-year time convention is used in the MACRS depreciation calculations for tangible personal property.
* This means that all assets placed in service during the year are treated as if use begin in the middle of the year, and one-half year of depreciation is allowed.
* When an asset is disposed of, the half-year convention is allowed again.
* If the asset is disposed of before the full recovery period is used, then only half of the normal depreciation deduction can be taken for the disposal year.

### GDS Recovery Rates

$$d_{k}= r_{k} \times B; 1 \le k\le N$$
