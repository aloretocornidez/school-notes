## Computation Patterns
These are problems that can be parallelized, how do we determine if/when we should use parallelization to optimize our problems?
- Matrix Multiplication
- Reduction: MapReduce problems in big data
- Gather/Scatter: quick-sort, matrix transpose
- Convolution

The way you store memory (one large unit vs four smaller units) can greatly affect the performance of an application.

## Computational Thinking
- Decomposition
	- Breaking big problems into smaller, easier to manage problems
- Pattern Recognition
	- 
- Abstraction
	- 
- Algorithm Design
