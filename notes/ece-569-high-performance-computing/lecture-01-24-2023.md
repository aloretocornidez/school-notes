### Cuda Parallelism Model - Multidimensional

- Vector Addition Kernel Launch (Host Code)
```cu
__host__ void vecAdd(float* h_A, float* h_B, float* h_C, int n)
{
	dim3 DimGrid((n-1) / 256 + 1, 1, 1);
	dim3 DimBlock(256, 1, 1);
	vecAddKernel<<<DimGrid, DimBlock>>>(d_A, b_B, d_C, n);
}

```


### Vector Addition Kernel
Each thread performs on epair-wise addition.
```cu
__global__
void vecAddKernel(float *A, float *B, float *C, int n)
{
	int i = block.Idx.x + blockDim.x * threadIdx.x;
	if(i < n) C[i] = A[i] + B[i];
}
```
Observations:
1. There is no loop in the code, it is replaced with a grid of threads.
2. With ```(i<n)``` we can operate on arbitrary array lengths.
	1. As long as this guard is in place, potential out-of-bound accesses are prevented when this code is running on multiple threads.


### A Multi-Dimensional Grid Example

- ```dim3 dimGrid(2, 2, 1)```
	- 4 blocks
- ```dim3 dimBlock(4, 2, 2)```
	- 16 threads
