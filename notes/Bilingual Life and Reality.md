This contains useful information that I gather from the readings in [[GER 150 - Becoming Multilingual - Classes]].

## Chapter 1 | Bilingual Adults

**Summary**: This chapter looks at the factors that lead to bilingualism, and at how extensive bilingualism really is.

Definition of "Bilingual"
	- Bilinguals are those who use two or more languages (or dialects) in their everyday lives.

Three Points made with regard to this definition.
1. Puts the emphasis of regular use of languages and not on fluency.
2. Includes dialects along with languages.
3. Includes two or more languages as some people speck three or four languages.

Why not use the word 'multilingual'?
- Some people are 'only' bilingual
- The word 'multilingual' is used less than 'bilingual' in reference to individuals.

Languages in the World
	- 7,000 Languages in the world
	- Europe: 239 Languages
	- Asia: 2,269 Languages
	- Pacific Islands: 


Larger Countries are usually more monolingual whereas, smaller countries usually contain more language diversity.

- Nancy Huston states: True bilinguals are those who learn to master two languages in early childhood and who can move back and forth between them smoothly and effortlessly.
- Leonard Bloomfield states that bilingualism was the native-like control of two languages.
- Christophe Thiery states: A true bilingual is someone who is taken to be one of themselves by the members of two different linguistic communities at roughly the same social and cultural level.
