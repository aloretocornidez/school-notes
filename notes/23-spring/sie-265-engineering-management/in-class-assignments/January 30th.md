#### In-Class Assignment Jan 30th, 2023

Suppose that the parents of a young child decide to make annual deposits into a savings​ account, with the first deposit being made on the​ child's fifth birthday and the last deposit being made on the 15th birthday.​ Then, starting on the child's 18th​ birthday, the withdrawals as shown on the diagram below will be made. If the effective annual interest rate is 8​% during this period of​ time, what are the annual deposits in years 5 through​ 15? Use a uniform gradient amount​ (G) in your solution.

We can do a $\frac{P}{G} + \frac{P}{A}$ calculation for the last part and the do an $A/F$ for the last part. This will allow us to reverse calculate the value.

An annuity of 2,100 that and a G 350

$$V_{18} = 2100\left(\frac{P}{A}, 8\%, 4\right)+ 350\left(\frac{P}{G}, 8\%, 4\right)$$

$$V_{18}= 2100(3.3121) + 350(4.6501)$$

$$V_{18}= 6955.41 + 1627.535 = 8582.945$$

Now that we have the value at year 18, we can find out how much money we must have at year 15

$$V_{15} = V_{18} \left(\frac{P}{F}, 8\%, 3\right)= 8582.945(0.7938)$$

$$V_{15} = 6813.141741$$

Now we need to see how much we need to contribute each year in order to get the value at year 15.

$$V_{5} = V_{15}\left(\frac{A}{F}, 8\%, 11\right) = 6813.141(0.0601) = 409.47$$

You must contribute 409.47 for 10 years in order to have the amount that is necessary at year 15.
