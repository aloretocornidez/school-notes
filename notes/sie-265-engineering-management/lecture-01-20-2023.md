# Time Value of Money

### Money has a Time Value
- **Capital**: refers to wealth in the form of money or property that can be used to produce more wealth.
- Engineering economy studies involve the commitment of capital for extended periods of time.
- A dollar today is worth more than a dollar one or more years from now (for several reasons) because of interest and/or profit it can earn.
- Other factors affecting money time-value are inflation/deflation and currency exchange (chapter 8).

### Return on Capital
- Interest and profit pay the providers of __capital for forgoing its use__ during the time the capital is being used.
- Onterest and profit are payments for __the risk the investor takes__ in letting another use his or her capital.

### Focusing on Interest Effect
- Simple Interest
	- Interest earned or charged is linearly proportional to the initial amount of the loan (**Principal**), the Interest rate, and the number of interest periods.
	- Mathematically, the interest stays constant.
- Compound Interest
	- For any interest period, compound interest reflects both the remaining principal and any accumulated interest up to the beginning of that period.
	- Mathematically, the growth of total capital is exponential.


### Simple vs Compound Interest Examples
For $1,000 loaned for three years at an interest rate of 10% compounded each period, what is the total due for repayment at the end of the third year?


### Computation of Simple Interest
Total interest earned  or payed may be computed using the formula:
$$I = PNi$$
where:

P = Principal amount lent or borrowed
N= Number of periods (e.g., years)
i = interest per period

If $5,000 were loaned for five years at a simple interest rate of 7% per year, the interest earned would be:
$1000 * 7% * 5 years = \$1,750 $

The total amount paid would then be:
$5,000 + $1,750 = $6,750 dollars.


### In-Class Assignment 4-B
You borrow $500 from a family member and agree to pay it back in six months. Because you are part of the family, you are only being charged simple interest at the rate of 0.5% per month. How much will you owe after six months? How much is the interest?

Initial Principle: $500
Interest Rate: 0.5% per month
Period: 6 months

Total Interest:
$\$500 * 0.05\% * 6\ months = \$15 dollars$

Total money paid is $515 dollars


### Economic Equvalence
- How can alternatives for providing the same service or accomplishing the same function be compared when interest is involved over extended periods of time?
	- Each alternative can be reduced to an equivalent basis dependent on interest rate, amount of money involved, and the timing of monetary receipts or expenses
- Using these elements, we can 'move' cash flows on the time-scale so that we can compare them at particular points in time.

### Notation
i = effective interest rate per interest period
N = number of compounding (interest) periods
P = present sum of money; equivalent value of one or more cash flows at a reference point in time; the present
F = future sum of money; equivalent value of one more more cash flows; the future
A = end-of-period cash flows in a uniform series continuing for a certain number of periods, starting at the end of the first period and continuing through the last.


### Cash Flow Diagrams | Basics
Cash Flow diagrams are an indispensable tool for clarifying and visualizing a series of cash flows.

**Example**
Suppose you have a $17,000 balance on your credit card, and you decide to repay the $17,000 debt in four months. An unpaid credit card balance at the beginning of a month will be charged interest at the rate of 1% by your credit card company.

When paying a loan at once (near the end)
$$\$17,690 - \$17,000 = \$690.27\ dollars$$

When paying a loan in early installments.\:
$$I = 4(\$4357.1) - \$17,000 = \$428.4\ dollars$$


Lesson: pay loans as soon as possible.
