Also known as the *Profit and Loss Statement* or the *Statement of revenue and expense*.

# Profit
### Kinds of Profit
There are many kinds of profit:
- Gross Profit
- Operating Profit
- Net Profit

### Gross Profit
$$P_{g}= \text{Sales} - \text{Cost of Goods Sold}$$

Gross profit is what is left after a company has paid the direct costs incurred in making the product or delivering the service.

Gross profit must be sufficient to cover a business's operating expenses, taxes, and financing costs.

### Operating Profit
$$P_{o} = \text{Gross Profit} - \text{Operating Expenses}$$

Operating profit shows the profit made from operating the business.

Operating profit is sometimes called *Earnings before interest and taxes*.

### Net Profit
$$P_{n} = \text{Operating Profit} - \text{Interest expenses, Taxes, and Additional costs}$$

Net profit is the bottom line of the income statement: What's left after all costs and expenses are subtracted from the revenue.
