# Comparison and Selection Among Alternatives

Chapter 6 is about conducting comparisons between invvestments.

## Section 6.1 - 6.4.1

### Introduction
- Our objective is to evaluate capital investment alternatives considering the time value of money.
- The decisions considered are those selecting from among a set of **mutually exclusive alternatives (MEAs)** - when selecting one excludes the choice of any of the others.
- We examine these based on economic considerations.
- The alternatives may have different initial investments and their annual revenues and costs may vary.

### Basic Concepts for Comparing Alternatives
- Based on principle 2 from chapter 1:
	- The alternative that requires the minimum investment of capital and produces satisfactory functional results will be chosen unless the incremental ca

- In other words, for alternatives having a larger investment than the base, if the extra benefits obtained by investing additional capital are better than those that could be obtained from an investment of the additional capital elsewhere in the company at the MARR, the investment should be made.

- To ensure comparable basis, the cash-flow estimates for the alternative must include the economic impact of differences such as:
	- Operational performance factors such as speed, reliability, set up time, etc.


### Types of Alternatives
- Investment alternatives:
	- Those with initial capital investment that produces positive cash flows from increased revenue, savings through reduced costs, or both.
	- The PW of all cash flows must be positive, at the MARR, to be attractive
- Cost Alternatives
	- Those with all negative cash flows 


### Determining the Study Period
- A study period (or planning horizon) is the time period over which MEAs are compared, and it must be appropriate for the decision situation.
- The determination of the study period for a decision situation may be influenced by several factors such as:
	- Service periods





## Section 6.5 - 6.6

### Comparing MEAs with Unequal Lives
**Repeatability Assumption**
- THe study period is either indefinitely long or equal to a common multiple of the MEAs useful lives.
- This assumes that the economic consequences expected during the MEA's life spans will recur in succeeding life scpans (replacements).

**Coterminated Assumption (widely used)**
- If repeatability cannot be used, an appropriate finite and identical study period must be selected for all MEAs.
- Cash flow adjustments may be needed to satisfy alternative performance needs over the study period.

**General Underlying Principle**
*Compare all MEAs being considered over the same study (analysis) period.*


**Useful Live < Study Period**
a. Cost Alternatives
- Contracting or leasing for the remaining years may be appropriate.
- Repeat part of the useful life and use an estimated market value to truncate the project a the end of the study period.


b. Investment Alternatives
- Net project value at the end of the useful life is reinvested in other opportunities at the MARR at the end of the study period. *Calculate the FW at the end of the study period*
- Replace with another asset at the end of the current asset's useful life, with possibly different cash flows



**Useful Life > Study Period**
