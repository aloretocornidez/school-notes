# Comparison and Selection Among Alternatives

Chapter 6 is about conducting comparisons between invvestments.

## Section 6.1 - 6.4.1

### Introduction
- Our objective is to evaluate capital investment alternatives considering the time value of money.
- The decisions considered are those selecting from among a set of **mutually exclusive alternatives (MEAs)** - when selecting one excludes the choice of any of the others.
- We examine these based on economic considerations.
- The alternatives may have different initial investments and their annual revenues and costs may vary.

### Basic Concepts for Comparing Alternatives
- Based on principle 2 from chapter 1:
	- The alternative that requires the minimum investment of capital and produces satisfactory functional results will be chosen unless the incremental ca

- In other words, for alternatives having a larger investment than the base, if the extra benefits obtained by investing additional capital are better than those that could be obtained from an investment of the additional capital elsewhere in the company at the MARR, the investment should be made.

- To ensure comparable basis, the cash-flow estimates for the alternative must include the economic impact of differences such as:
	- Operational performance factors such as speed, reliability, set up time, etc.


### Types of Alternatives
- Investment alternatives:
	- Those with initial capital investment that produces positive cash flows from increased revenue, savings through reduced costs, or both.
	- The PW of all cash flows must be positive, at the MARR, to be attractive
- Cost Alternatives
	- Those with all negative cash flows 


### Determining the Study Period
- A study period (or planning horizon) is the time period over which MEAs are compared, and it must be appropriate for the decision situation.
- The determination of the study period for a decision situation may be influenced by several factors such as:
	- Service periods
