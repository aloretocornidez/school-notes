# Evaluating A Single Project | Chapter 5



## Section 5.1 - 5.3

### Single Project Economic Evaluation
**Objective**: We will be able to evaluate the economic trade-off between annual savings/revenues of an investment project and the up-front and ongoing costs of that project to determine whether it is a smart trade-off


Proposed capital projects can be evaluated in several ways:
- Present Worth
- Future Worth
- Annual Worth
- Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
- External Rate of Return (ERR)
- Payback Period (generally not appropriate as a primary decision rule)

To be attractive, a capital project must provide a return that exceed a minimum level established by the top management of an organization.

This minimum level is reflected in a firm's **Minimum Attractive Rate of Return (MARR)**

In theory, the MARR is sometimes called the **hurdle rate**, it should be chosen to maximize the economic well-well being of an organization

Many elements contribute to determining the MARR:
- Account, source, and const of money available
- Number and purpose of good projects available
- Perceived risk of investment opportunities.
- Type of organization (e.g., government, utility company, private company)


### Present Worth (PW) Method
Present worth is based on the concept of equivalent worth of all cash flows relative to some base or beginning point in time.

PW Deesicino Rule:
$$If PW (i=MARR) \ge 0$$
Then the investment is justified.


It is important to observe that the higher the interest rate and the farther into the future a cash flow occurs, the lower its PW is.

*Example*: PW of $1,000 recieved at end of ear k at an interest rate of i% per year.


### Example
A retrofitted space heating system is being considered for a small office building. The system can be purchased and installed for \$100,000, and it will save an estimated 300,000 kilowatt-hours 9kWh) of electric power each year over a six-year period. A kilowatt-hour of electricity costs \$0.10, and the company uses a MARR 15% per year in its economic evaluations of refurbished systems. The market value of the system will be \$8,000 at the end of six years, and the additional annual operating and maintenance expenses are negligible. Use the PW method to determine whether this system should be installed.

**Solution**
$$P_{0\_investment} = 100,000; N = 6; MARR = 15\%, F_{6\_futurevalue}$$
