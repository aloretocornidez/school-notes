## Engineering Economy and the Design Process


### Engineering Economic Analysis Procedure
Step
1. Problem Recognition, definition, and evaluation
2. Development of the feasible alternatives
3. Development of the outcomes and cash flows for each alternative
4. Selection of a criterion (or criteria).
5. Analysis and comparison of the alternatives.
6. Selection of the preferred alternative
7. Performance monitoring and post-evaluation of results

Activity
1. Problem need/definition.
2. Problem/need formulation and evaluation.
3. Synthesis of possible solutions (alternatives).
4. Analysis, optimization, and evaluation.
5. Specification of preferred alternatives.
6. Communication.


### Engineering Economic Analysis Procedure
1. Problem Definition
	1. A problem is normally stimulated by internal or external needs or requirements.
	2. Its formulation should be viewed from a systems persective establishing the elements of the problem and whatconstitutes its environment.
2. Development of Alternatives
	1. GIGO (Garbage in garbage out)
	2. Searching for potential alternatives.
	3. Screening to select a smaller group of feasible alternatives for detailed analysis.
3. Development of prospective outcomes
	1. Represent the economic effects of an alternatives in terms of money spent (costs) and received (revenues) --> **cash flow analysis**
	2. Non-monetary factors (attributes) often play a significant role in the final recommendation. *(Environmental concerns, customer satisfaction, worker safety).*
4. Selection of a decision criterion
5. Analysis and comparison of alternatives
	1. Based on cash-flow estimates for the feasible alternatives selected
	2. Compared based on their differences in terms of a monetary unit such as dollars.
	3. However, other factors can be considered as well.
6. Selection of the preferred alternative
7. Performance monitoring and post evaluation of results
	1. Comparing actual results achieved with the previously estimated outcomes
	2. Feedback from post-implementation evaluation is important to the continuing improvement of operations or improving the design in future iterations.

### Example: Help Your Friend

A friend of yours bought a small apartment building for $100,000 in a college town. She spent $10,000 of her own money for the building and obtained a mortgage from a local bank for the remaining $90,000. The annual mortgage payment to the bank is $10,500. Your friend also expects that annual maintenance on the building and grounds will be $15,000. There are four apartments (two bedrooms each) in the building that can each be rented for $360 per month. Refer to the seven-step procedure Engineering Economic Analysis to answer these questions:

1. Does your friend have a problem? If so, what is it?
2. What are her alternatives? (Identify at least three.)
3. Estimate the economic consequences and other required data for the alternatives in part (2)
 

**Discussion**
A quick set of calculations shows that your friend does have  problem:
$$Annual\ Spending = \$10,500 + \$15,000 = \$25,500$$
$$Annual\ Income = 4 * \$360 * 12 = \$17,280$$
The problem could be that the monthly rent is too low. She's losing $8,220 per year. (Now, that's a problem!)

Her Alternatives
**Options:**
1. Raise the rent (Will the market bear an increase?)
2. Lower maintenance expenses (but not so far as to cause safety problems).
3. Sell the apartment building. (What about a loss?)
4. Abandon the building (bad for your friend's reputation).

**Estimate the economic consequences**
1. Raise the total monthly rent:
	1. To break even, you must do almost a 50% increase.
2. Lower monthly expenses
