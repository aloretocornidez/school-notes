### Question 1

The amount accumulated for the first nine years:

$$V_{34}= A\left(\frac{F}{A}, 15\%, 9\right)= 3,250(16.7858) = 54,533.85$$

The amount that is accumulated for the next (65 - 9 - 25 = 31) years while the account lays there.

$$F_{65} = F_{34}\left(\frac{F}{P}, 15\%, 31 yrs\right)= 54533.85(76.1435)$$

The amount of money that must be present in the account to be able to take out \$5,000 every year, F(10):
$$F_{10} = A(P/A, i\%, N_1) = 5,000 (2.8839,2\%, 3) = 14419.5$$

In order to have 14,419.50 in the account in year ten, we must have this much money in the account at year 5.


$$F_5 = F_{10} (P/F, 2\%, 5) = 14419.5 (0.9057) = 13059.74115$$


In order to get to 13,059.71 at year five, we must contribute this amount for five years.

$$F_0 = F_5 (A/F, 2\%, 5) = 13059.74115(0.1922) = 2510.0822$$
