This contains useful information that I gather from the readings in [[GER 150 - Becoming Multilingual - Classes]].

## Chapter 1 | Bilingual Adults

**Summary**: This chapter looks at the factors that lead to bilingualism, and at how extensive bilingualism really is.

Definition of "Bilingual"
	- Bilinguals are those who use two or more languages (or dialects) in their everyday lives.

Three Points made with regard to this definition.
1. Puts the emphasis of regular use of languages and not on fluency.
2. Includes dialects along with languages.
3. Includes two or more languages as some people speck three or four languages.

Why not use the word 'multilingual'?
- Some people are 'only' bilingual
- The word 'multilingual' is used less than 'bilingual' in reference to individuals.

Languages in the World
	- 7,000 Languages in the world
	- Europe: 239 Languages
	- Asia: 2,269 Languages
	- Pacific Islands: 

Larger Countries are usually more monolingual whereas, smaller countries usually contain more language diversity.

## Chapter 2 | Describing Bilinguals

**Summary**: How can we define what constitutes as a bilingual? This question is addressed in this chapter.

Criteria that Constitutes a Bilingual?
	- Equally fluent in two languages?
	- Growing up with two languages?
	- Incorporating the regular use of two or more languages.

### Language Fluency or Language Use?
- Nancy Huston states: True bilinguals are those who learn to master two languages in early childhood and who can move back and forth between them smoothly and effortlessly.
- Leonard Bloomfield states that bilingualism was the native-like control of two languages.
- Christophe Thiery states: A true bilingual is someone who is taken to be one of themselves by the members of two different linguistic communities at roughly the same social and cultural level.

## Chapter 3 | The Functions of Languages
### What Languages are Used For
#ComplementarityPrinciple #definition
Complementarity Principle: 
Bilinguals usually acquire and use their languages for different purposes, in different domains of life, with different people. Different aspects of life often require different languages

#Diglossia
Diglossia:
Where two languages or two varieties of a language are employed by a group, each language has a very precise domain of use.

- Different Languages Cover Different Domains of Life
	- The reason to be bilingual is because it is uncommon that a single language covers all domains of life. 

### The Impact of the Complementarity Principle
- **Language Fluency**
	- If a language is spoken in a reduced number of domains and with a limited number of people, it will not be developed as well.
		- This can occur in speaking, writing, and reading.
	-  Borrowing is 2x-5x more common when someone is speaking with another bilingual.
	- Fluency in a language can be different depending on the domain of what you're speaking (i.e. statistics in french vs statistics in english).
- **Language Dominance**
	- People may have a language that is dominant in general over the other languages.
	- Language dominance may also be different depending on the domains in which they are used. If someone uses Language A in one domain and Language B in another domain, the person may be dominance in each of the respective domains.
- **Translation**
	- *Myth: Bilinguals are born translators.*
	- Bilinguals' lack of translation skills can be explained by means of the complementarity principle.
	- Unless the person has a domain of both languages covered in their language knowledge, translation may be difficult. 
- **Memory**
	- Bilinguals remember things better when the language that is used for recall matches the language that is used at the time of the event in a particular event. (ex. Aneta Pavlenko: . When asked, in Russian, for her apartment number in the United States, she erroneously provided the number of her old apartment in her native country, which she knew in Russian)
	- Bilinguals are more likely to retrieve events (memories) that occurred in a particular language if that same language is also used in the retrieval setting.

The complementarity principle is certainly one of the most pervasive aspects of individual bilingualism. Bilinguals who speak two  or more languages feel its constant presence in their everyday lives.  They may even comment openly on its different manifestations,  without finding the exact words to account for them.
