This contains useful information that I gather from the readings in [[GER 150 - Becoming Multilingual - Classes]].

## Chapter 1 | Bilingual Adults

**Summary**: This chapter looks at the factors that lead to bilingualism, and at how extensive bilingualism really is.

Definition of "Bilingual"
	- Bilinguals are those who use two or more languages (or dialects) in their everyday lives.

Three Points made with regard to this definition.
1. Puts the emphasis of regular use of languages and not on fluency.
2. Includes dialects along with languages.
3. Includes two or more languages as some people speck three or four languages.

Why not use the word 'multilingual'?
- Some people are 'only' bilingual
- The word 'multilingual' is used less than 'bilingual' in reference to individuals.

Languages in the World
	- 7,000 Languages in the world
	- Europe: 239 Languages
	- Asia: 2,269 Languages
	- Pacific Islands: 


Larger Countries are usually more monolingual whereas, smaller countries usually contain more language diversity.


## Chapter 2 | Describing Bilinguals

**Summary**: How can we define what constitutes as a bilingual? This question is addressed in this chapter.


Criteria that Constitutes a Bilingual?
	- Equally fluent in two languages?
	- Growing up with two languages?
	- Incorporating the regular use of two or more languages.

### Language Fluency or Language Use?
- Nancy Huston states: True bilinguals are those who learn to master two languages in early childhood and who can move back and forth between them smoothly and effortlessly.
- Leonard Bloomfield states that bilingualism was the native-like control of two languages.
- Christophe Thiery states: A true bilingual is someone who is taken to be one of themselves by the members of two different linguistic communities at roughly the same social and cultural level.



## Chapter 3 | The Functions of Languages
### What Languages are Used For
#ComplementarityPrinciple
Complementarity Principle: 
Bilinguals usually acquire and use their languages for different purposes, in different domains of life, with different people. Different aspects of life often require different languages

#Diglossia
Diglossia:
Where two languages or two varieties of a language are employed by a group, each language has a very precise domain of use.

- Different Languages Cover Different Domains of Life
	- The reason to be bilingual is because it is uncommon that a single language covers all domains of life. 



### The Impact of the Complementarity Principle
- **Language Fluency**
	- If a language is spoken in a reduced number of domains and with a limited number of people, it will not be developed as well.
		- This can occur in speaking, writing, and reading.
	-  Borrowing is 2x-5x more common when someone is speaking with another bilingual.
	- Fluency in a language can be different depending on the domain of what you're speaking (i.e. statistics in french vs statistics in english).
- **Language Dominance**
	-
